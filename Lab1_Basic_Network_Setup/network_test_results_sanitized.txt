Basic Network Setup & System Check Lab 

Date: November 7, 2025
System: Lenovo Laptop — Windows 10
Host Name: [Local Device]

Objective:
To understand basic networking concepts and perform a simple local system diagnostic using built-in Windows tools.

Commands Tested:
ipconfig /all
ping 8.8.8.8
tracert 8.8.8.8
nslookup google.com

Observations:
Network Configuration (ipconfig /all)
Wi-Fi Adapter: Realtek RTL8852BE WiFi 6 802.11ax PCIe Adapter
Media State: Connected
DHCP Enabled: Yes
IPv4 Address: [Private IP Redacted]
DNS Server: Provided by Comcast
Default Gateway: Assigned dynamically
Interpretation: Connected via Wi-Fi using DHCP. Comcast DNS servers handle resolution.

Connectivity Test (ping 8.8.8.8)
Packets: Sent = 4, Received = 4, Lost = 0 (0% loss)
Minimum = 13ms, Maximum = 28ms, Average = 19ms
Interpretation: Stable connection with low latency.

Route Trace (tracert 8.8.8.8)
Path: Started at local router, passed through regional ISP nodes, reached Google DNS.
Interpretation: Normal routing with expected hops and one non-responsive node (not an error).

DNS Resolution (nslookup google.com)
Server: cdns01.comcast.net
Address: [Redacted]
Interpretation: DNS resolution successful, confirming domain lookup functionality.

💡 Summary
- Verified DHCP configuration and adapter connectivity.
- Confirmed stable internet connection and low latency.
- Validated routing and DNS resolution.
- Demonstrated basic networking and troubleshooting skills.
