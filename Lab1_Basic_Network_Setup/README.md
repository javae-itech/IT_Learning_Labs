⚙️ Tools Used
| Tool | Purpose |
|------|----------|
| **Windows Command Prompt (cmd)** | Run network and system diagnostics |
| **ipconfig /all** | View network adapter configuration |
| **ping** | Test latency and connectivity |
| **tracert** | Show network hops to destination |
| **nslookup** | Test DNS resolution |
| **Notepad** | Document observations |

🧪 Steps Performed
1. Checked network configuration with `ipconfig /all`  
2. Tested connectivity with `ping 8.8.8.8`  
3. Traced route to Google DNS with `tracert 8.8.8.8`  
4. Resolved a domain name using `nslookup google.com`  
5. Recorded all findings in `network_test_results_sanitized.txt`

📊 Results Summary (Sanitized)
- **Ping Test:** 0% packet loss ✅  
- **Traceroute:** 12 hops — standard connection path ✅  
- **DNS Lookup:** Successful domain resolution ✅  
- **DHCP:** Enabled — system automatically received IP ✅  

🛡 Sensitive identifiers (MAC, IP, hostnames) have been blurred.
